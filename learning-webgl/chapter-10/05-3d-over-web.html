                <h2>Great Designs Come from Great Designers --- Not from Great Design Processes</h2>

                <p>The basic premise underlying the SEI's [Software
                    Engineering Institute] work on software process maturity
                    is that the quality of a software product is largely
                    determined by the quality of the software development
                    and maintenance processes used to build it.</p>

                Mark Paulk [1995], "The evolution of the SEI's capability maturity model for software"

                <p>...[W]hile some may see them as the crazy ones, we see
                    genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think
                    that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>

                Steve Jobs, Apple commercial (1997)
